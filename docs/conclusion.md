# Conclusion: From Storage to Intelligence

The future of observability is not **"more storage"** but **"smarter collection"** By moving anomaly detection to the edge, architects transform their pipelines into active filters. This results in:

* Faster MTTR: Alerts are triggered at the source.
* Reduced Cloud Costs: Egress is optimized for value, not volume.
* Resilient Infrastructure: Intelligent sampling ensures that when the "needle" appears in the haystack, it is never discarded.
